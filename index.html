<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Alexander Post, and I am a Master of Science student studying at Santa Clara University. I had the privilege of working internships at RSM and EY, two unique experiences that inspired me to get involved in management consulting. I love working through difficult cases and thinking holistically about growth, and I am so excited to continue to uncover the role of digital transformation during this exciting period. Outside of work and school, I thoroughly enjoy weightlifting, hiking, snowboarding, road trips, and working on my cars! Happy to chat!</p>
